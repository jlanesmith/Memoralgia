# Memoralgia
An app that reminds you of memories on their anniversaries. Be prepared to feel nostalgic!

Note: Production of this app has halted for the forseeable future, since I'm not sure if I want to always feel nostalgic.

## Development
In case I do want to keep developing this app, here are some general instructions.

1. Start up the development server by going to the app directory and entering the command `yarn start`
2. Once ready to deploy, enter the command `expo build:android` and send the APK file to phone
