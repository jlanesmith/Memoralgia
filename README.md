# Memoralgia
An app that reminds you of memories on their anniversaries. Be prepared to feel nostalgic!

Note: Production of this app has halted for the forseeable future, since I'm not sure if I want to always feel nostalgic.

## Development
In case I do want to keep developing this app, here are some general instructions.

1. Start up the development server by going to the app directory and entering the command `yarn start`
2. Once ready to deploy, enter the command `expo build:android` and send the APK file to phone

As a reminder, the file that stores the memories is called Memories.tsx. This is stored in the main directory of the app, but has not been included in source control for obvious privacy reasons.
